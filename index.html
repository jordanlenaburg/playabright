                    <h4>About PlayaBright</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-1"></div>
                <div class="col-10">
                    <p>The idea for PlayaBright started in 2016. While at Burning Man, we thought to ourselves, "These
                        bike lights are boring. They're always the same color, and the patterns are limited. What other
                        kinds of lights can we use instead?"</p>
                    <p>We considered RGB strip lighting, but it was not super flexible or durable, plus it ate a ton of
                        power. So we began our search for the perfect lights to use at the burn. They had to be durable.
                        They had to be portable. They had to be powered by realistic means. But most of all, they had to
                        be <i>beautiful</i>. We searched the world for the perfect lights.</p>
                    <p>Enter PlayaBright Lights! Originally designed for building-sized signage, we discovered these
                        lights were perfect for the burn. They are completely waterproof, dust-proof, shock-resistant,
                        and highly durable. They are individually addressable (for all you Arduino junkies out there),
                        and can make almost any color there is. All we needed was a way to control them and power
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Our journey led us to controllers for RGB strips. But we needed them to be portable. So,
                        working with our suppliers, we came up with a design powered by a usb port, which then powers
                        the lights. To make them even cooler, we gave them a remote control. No more trying to find your
                        bike in a sea of bikes when you can just change the pattern to find it. Just like finding your
                        car in a parking lot.</p>
                    <p>But we didn't stop there. We now had the lights, and could make them portable but how long would
                        they last? So, through extensive testing, we learned the electricity draw of the lights, and
                        began our search once again for a suitable power supply. We eventually found high capacity power
                        banks which could be charged <i>completely</i> via solar (attached, of course), and could power
                        the lights for an entire night.</p>
                    <p>With that, the puzzle was complete, and PlayaBright was born.</p>

                        <summary>How long will the lights last?</summary>
                        <p>This is actually a tricky question to answer, and it's better to ask, "How much electricity
                            will the lights use?" A single string of lights will draw between 1500 to 1800 mA per hour
                            at full brightness. In practical terms, this means that the 10000 power bank we offer will
                            power them for about 6.5 hours at full brightness.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>6.5 hours is great, but can they last longer?</summary>
                        <p>YES! Because PlayaBright Lights have adjustable brightness, you can adjust how much total
                            energy they use. By lowering the brightness two clicks (which in our opinion is still <i>plenty</i>
                            bright), you can extend the life of the lights almost <b>four times</b>! That's 24 hours on
                            a single charge of the power bank!.</p>

                        <summary>Speaking of the power bank, how long does it take to charge?</summary>
                        <p>Under direct sunlight, the power bank can be charged from 0% to 100% in ~16 hours. Via wall
                            outlet, from 4-6 hours.</p>

                        <summary>Your power bank takes 2 amps to charge. What's up with that?</summary>
                        <p>We will admit the <i>only</i> drawback of our power banks is that it requires a 2 amp wall
                            charger. It was a major point of contention with our supplier, and we almost didn't go with
                            them, until we negotiated to include a wall charger with the power bank. Then it was all
                            gravy.</p>

                        <summary>These lights are awesome, but I want to program them myself. How can I?</summary>
                        <p>The lights use an integrated circuit (IC) type of TM1914A. If you are going to try using your
                            own controller, make sure it supports this IC.</p>

                        <summary>How many strings of PlayaBright Lights can you string together?</summary>
                        <p>In our testing, we found that more than 3 strings on a single controller began to discolor
                            the lights at the end due to the energy required to reach the end. We were able to fix it
                            though by reducing the brightness of the lights.</p>

                        <p>Only if the lights have IC TM1914A chips.</p>

                        <summary>You talk a lot about the durability of PlayaBright Lights. Are your claims true?
                        </summary>
                        <p>PlayaBright Lights are 100% waterproof. We tested this by fully submerging them in water and
                            they worked great. This means they are dust-proof as well. The rubber casing of the lights
                            makes them shock resistant. We are so confident about the durability of our lights that we
                            offer a 4 year warranty with them. If the lights fail within 4 years, we will provide a
                            refund or replacement product.</p>

                        <summary>I like your stuff. Do you have any more products?</summary>
                        <p>Not yet. We decided to start small, one product at a time. We plan to expand, but we want to
                            offer only the <i>highest</i> quality items. This means that we have to be really picky
                            about what we choose to carry.</p>
